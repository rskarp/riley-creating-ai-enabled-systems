# Task 2: Requirements Analysis

## Task 2.1: List Functional & Non-functional Requirements

Functional

1. CEO wants fraud to be detected as quickly as possible when the transaction occurs.
2. Credit card users want to receive as few transaction confirmation notifications as possible.
3. Chief Risk Officer wants to minimize the highest risk fraud type, which is account take over.
4. Chief Risk Officer wants the system to prioritize reducing the amount of financial loss instead of total number of fraudulent transactions.
5. CEO and Chief Risk Officer want comprehensive reporting and analytics including fraud detection rate, false negative & false positive rates, time to detection, and customer satisfaciton.

Non-functional

1. CEO wants new system to exceed previous metrics of 40% precision and 85% recall.
2. COO & Legal team want the system to follow all data handling and privacy laws.
3. CEO and Head of Credit Card Operations want the system to integrate with customer relationship management platforms, payment systems, analytic tools.
4. Engineering and legal teams want the system and design decisions to be well-documented.
5. CEO and Chief Risk Officer want to prioritize fraud detection rate and maximize true positives.

## Task 2.2: Analyze and Prioritize Requirements

The requirements are listed here again, but this time in order from highest priority to lowest. The highest priority items are the ones that could cause legal trouble and business failure if not met. All data privacy laws need to be followed, and documentation is required for auditing purposes. The next four requirements define the whole purpose of the system, which is what fraud should be detected, and how the system needs to perform in order to be useful. Not meeting these requirements would likely prevent system deployment. The next two requirements (#7 and #8) are optimization goals, but are not given quantifiable thresholds. Falling slightly short on these requirements would likely not prevent system deployment, but could result in poor customer feedback or loss of customers. The last two requirements are nice-to-haves, but are not absolutely necessary for the system. Although tedious, these tasks could be performed manually.

7. Credit card users want to receive as few transaction confirmation notifications as possible.
8. CEO wants fraud to be detected as quickly as possible when the transaction occurs.
9. CEO wants the system to have a flexible and customizable alert system to notify stakeholders such as fraud analysts and customer service representatives about flagged transactions.
10. CEO and Head of Credit Card Operations want the system to integrate with customer relationship management platforms, payment systems, analytic tools.
