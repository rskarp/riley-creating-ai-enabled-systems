# Task 1: Elicitation and Gathering Requirements

## Task 1.1: Identify two stakeholders

1. One stakeholder I'd approach is the MLOps/DevOps team responsible for deploying and maintaining the original existing fraud detection model. These engineers would have the most insight into the technical details regarding how the current production model behaves, how it's monitored and re-trained/re-deployed, and when that monitoring may have indicated any recent issues. I'd engage this team via group meeting (with the whole team, or the manager & technical leads depending on team size).
2. Another stakeholder I'd approach is the customer service team responsible for managing communications with customers and merchants. This team would have the most insight (both good and bad) into how users (both credit card users and merchants) view our current system. They'd also know about manual ways they have to intervene when the automated fraud detection system fails or is uncertain. Again, I'd engage this team via group meeting (with the whole team, or the manager & leads depending on team size).

## Task 1.2: List two questions you would ask each stakeholder

- Stakeholder 1: MLOps/DevOps Team
  - What metrics, performance indicators, and reports are currently generated, how frequently are the reports produced, and how are the reports currently used?
  - Are there any recent events or changes in data or reported metrics and indicators that may correlate with the recent decrease in fraud detection performance?
- Stakeholder 2: Customer Service Team
  - What are some of the most common pieces of feedback received from merchants and credit card users regarding fraud-related issues?
  - What are your least favorite parts about your involvement in handling fraud-related incidents and what parts do you wish were automated (e.g. notifying customers of fraud, handling customer-initiated fraud disputes, overridingthe system/making fraud decision when the system is uncertain, etc...)?
